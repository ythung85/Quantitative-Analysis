# Quantitative-Analysis

## Main Purpose

The reason why I save the code in Github is that I would like to recond the knowledge I learned in the Course "Quantitative Analysis" taught by Prof. Kuan, Chung-Min.

In this folder of quantitative analysis, I would share the solution of the example.
I would type the question first, and use the code to execute the requirement of the problem.

Basically, the problem is from " Introductary Econometrics A Modern Approach" by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge.
